# 🧠 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

A multi-disease prediction platform leveraging machine learning to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis of critical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, lung cancer, and thyroid disorders. Developed as part of the **AICTE Internship 2024** under the **TechSaksham initiative** by Microsoft and SAP.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern healthcare faces challenges due to the complexity of diseases and massive clinical data. This project addresses the diagnostic delay and human error risk by providing an AI-assisted diagnostic system built on ML models, integrated into a unified and intuitive web interface.

**Average Model Accuracy**: **89.2%**  
**Technologies Used**: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Anaconda, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook

## 🩺 Supported Disease Models

- 🫀 Heart Disease
- 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease
- 🍬 Diabetes
